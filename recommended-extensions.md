## Extensions
The general rule of thumb is (in any browser, but specifically Chrome/Chromium) to minimize the use of extensions, unless you know *why* you need them.

However, my "minimize sending of data to third-parties set" includes:

* [uBlockOrigin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) - An open-source content blocker.
* [uMatrix](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/umatrix/ogfcmafjalglgifnmanfmnieipoejdcf) - An companion extension to uBo that allows you to select which parts of a website to allow to see various functions in Chrome/Chromium, such as IPv6, javascript, WebWorkers, local filesystem access and more.
* [Decentraleyes](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/decentraleyes/ldpochfccmkkmhdbclfhpagapcfdljkj) - Local Injection of (usually served) CDN resources, limiting data exposure to third party sites such as Microsoft, OneDrive, Google, DropBox, etc.
* [Marvellous Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-marvellous-suspender/noogafoofpebimajpfpamcfhoaifemoa) - Suspends Tabs that aren't used for a timeframe, saving memory and resources.
* [NeverDecaf's chromium-web-store](https://github.com/NeverDecaf/chromium-web-store) - Allows adding extensions from chrome web store on ungoogled-chromium
