# the-chromium-fold

## What this is ....

A repository to keep my chosen Chromium browser hacks, plugins, local flags and other bits and pieces.

## What this isn't ....

A one-stop shop to update **your** Chromium profiles. If, of course, you are setting up a *brand new* Chromium profile, you might get something out of this, but if things break, you get to keep all the broken pieces!
